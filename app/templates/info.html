        <p>Wedding attire, duh. </p>
        <p>In all seriousness, it's most important you feel confident and comfortable. We're recommending something in the nebulous zone of somewhere between "cocktail attire" and "semi-formal". </p>
        <p>The ceremony and reception will be indoors.</p>
    <h1 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h1>
        <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be at <a href="https://www.unionpine.com/">Union / Pine</a>. </p>
